-- | Purescript's built-in `Int` type is restricted to 32-bit integers. However, the
-- | Javascript runtime is capable of working with 53-bit integers. So, this module
-- | provides an `Int53` type, for cases where you want all 53 bits
-- | (from -9,007,199,254,740,991 to 9,007,199,254,740,991).
-- |
-- | For even larger numbers, consider
-- | [purescript-bigints](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-bigints), or
-- | [purescript-hugenums](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-hugenums).
-- | The advantage of purescript-int-53 over those is that purescript-int-53 is likely
-- | to be faster, since it provides a "thinner" wrapper over the underlying Javascript
-- | operations.
-- |
-- | ### Making an `Int53`
-- |
-- | To create an `Int53` from a `Number`, use [`fromNumber`](#v:fromNumber) or, more often,
-- | [`ceil`](#v:ceil), [`floor`](#v:floor), [`round`](#v:round) or [`truncate`](#v:truncate).
-- |
-- | To create an `Int53` from an `Int`, use [`fromInt`](#v:fromInt).
-- |
-- | If you're starting from a `String`, then there is [`fromString`](#:v:fromString).
-- |
-- | ### Using an `Int53`
-- |
-- | Once you have an `Int53`, you can do things like add, subtract, multiply,
-- | etc., in the usual way, since the ordinary classes for arithmetic are
-- | implemented. It should feel pretty much like using an ordinary integer.
-- |
-- | There are also functions for [`even`](#v:even), [`odd`](#v:odd), [`pow`](#v:pow),
-- | and [`abs`](#v:abs).
-- |
-- | ### Converting an `Int53` to something else
-- |
-- | When you need a `Number` again, you can use [`toNumber`](#v:toNumber) -- and when you need
-- | an `Int`, there is [`toInt`](#v:toInt).
-- |
-- | To get back to a `String`, there is a `Show` instance, so you can use `show`.
-- | However, that includes the `Int53` tag in the resulting string, so you might
-- | sometimes want [`toString`](#v:toString) instead.
-- |
-- | ### The `Int53Value` class
-- |
-- | There is also a class for [`Int53Value`](#t:Int53Value), which might sometimes be useful if you
-- | have a function where you'd like to accept either an `Int` or an `Int53`.
-- | Often you won't need this.

-- Internally, an Int53 is a newtype over a `Number`. We implement the various
-- arithmetic classes in a way that should guarantee that the `Number` is actually
-- an integer. Note that we can't expose the `Int53` constructor by itself, since
-- that would allow the construction of an `Int53` which isn't actually an integer.

-- | A 53-bit signed integer.
-- |
-- | It is implemented a newtype over a `Number` (that is, a Javascript number),
-- | with matters arranged so that it will always be an integer.
-- |
-- | In case you've forgotten what all the instances mean, you've got:
-- |
-- |     Semiring: add, zero, mul, one, (+), (*)
-- |     Ring: sub, (-), negate
-- |     EuclideanRing: div, mod, (/), degree
-- |
-- | ... plus the usual `Eq`, `Ord` and `Show`.
-- |
-- | There's also `top` and `bottom` from `Bounded`, which indicate the maximum
-- | and minimum values available for an `Int53`.
